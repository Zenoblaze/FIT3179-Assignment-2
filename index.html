            <p>Some of the biggest esport teams generally have sponsors with different technology companis as a large source of revenue.
                In return for representing the sponsor companies by wearing clothes with their logos, or using their gear, esport teams
                are reimbursed. In this manner the team takes a large portion and pays out their players depending on their contracts.

            <p> As of 2021 when this data was taken the top 10 games with the highest prize pool are:
                Dota 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Fortnite, League of Legends, Overwatch,
                PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, StarCraft II, Overwatch, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds: Mobile,

            <p>It should be noted however that the prize pool for Dota 2's tournaments are an outlier
                due to crowdsourcing funds via contributing money from their yearly battlepass sales.
