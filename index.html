          Esports refers to "electronic sports". This in particular refers to games of a competitive nature where teams compete
          to win by defeating other teams of players. Generally tournaments will be held in an elimination or double elimination format
          similar to chess. There are other styles of tournament, and it depends on the game, and tournament as to how they are run.
          <br><br>
          Some major esport tournaments for games such as "Dota 2" rival traditional sports in terms of their prize pools with Dota 2's international tournaments
          reaching prizes of over $40 million USD, that is similar to that of Wimbelton at $45 million USD!

        <h2 style="color:darkcyan">Esports Globally</h2>
        <p>Esports are not just contained to western countries, with players from all over the world being able to particpate in tournaments online or in person. Although a lot of professional esports players originate
          from countries such as the USA, China, South Korea, and Russia. It is interesting to note that despite having many casual players, Japan does not have a huge esports presence due to esport events
          being considered gambling!

          The below graph shows the earnings per player from different countries around the world as of 2022. Looking at the bar chart on the right you can compare the number of players from the top 50 esport countries.

        <h2 style="color:darkcyan">Esports Teams & Players</h2>
        <p>Although funding from tournaments may be the most obvious way that professional esport players can earn money, just like more traditional sports
          there are esport organisation, teams, and players.
          <br><br>
          Games such as Dota 2, League of Legends, and Fortnite tend to have the biggest prize pools as their
          parent companies Valve, Riot, and Epic Games are massive and the games themselves have large player-bases. Esports are voliatile in that if the sport loses popularity,
          the prize pools diminish.

        <p> As of 2021 when this data was taken the top 10 games with the highest prize pool are:
          Dota 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Fortnite, League of Legends, Overwatch,
          PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, StarCraft II, Overwatch, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds: Mobile,
          and Hearthstone</p>

              There are two main outliers on the graph below. The first being Dota 2. The reason that there are multiple values over $10 million
              is that every year for their international tournament, sponsored by Valve (a game store platform), a potion of the money earned by Valve via the ingame "battepass" sales
              is contributed to the prize pool every year. <br><br> The other main outlier is one of the fortnite tournaments with an abnormally high value. This tournament was the first Fortnite world cup
              an international tournament that since 2021 is planned to be annual in a similar manner to Dota 2's international.
